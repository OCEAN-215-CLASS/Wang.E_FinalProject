## Introduction

I explore the relationship between time and location of marine microplastic concentrations. Combining the Python packages of matplotlib, pandas, numpy, cartopy, and datetime and graphs including maps, line plots, and scatter plots, I do find that microplastic concentrates most around the coastlines of the Atlantic Ocean. Also, there is a trend of increase and decrease along with year in the Pacific Ocean and the southwest of the Atlantic Ocean.
